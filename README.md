# Music Genre Classification with Deep Learning

## Description

We adapt the model from [here] (https://github.com/keunwoochoi/music-auto_tagging-keras) to train a custom music genre classification system with our own genres and data. 

Currently the genres supported are the [GTZAN dataset](http://marsyasweb.appspot.com/download/data_sets/) tags:

- Blues
- Classical
- Country
- Disco
- HipHop
- Jazz
- Metal
- Pop
- Reggae
- Rock
